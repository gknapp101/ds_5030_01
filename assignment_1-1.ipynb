    "## Questions from the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One question we could ask from the data is: What is the most purchased liquor category in each ZIP code each month? Using this information, we could develop a prediction tool to forecast the most popular liquor categories by ZIP code in the following months. Liquor store owners would be key stakeholders in this analysis, as these insights would help them prioritize inventory planning and purchasing based on expected demand in the areas they serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this raises concerns around data privacy and informed consent. Even when data is anonymized, using detailed geographic data such as ZIP codes can still pose privacy risks. Consumers are often unaware that their purchasing behavior is being analyzed in this way, which may conflict with principles of transparency and consent. To mitigate these concerns, data could be aggregated at a broader geographic level, or used with clearer communication to consumers about how their data is collected and applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question we could ask from the data is: Which vendors generate the highest sales revenue in each store each quarter? Using this information, we could develop a prediction tool to forecast the top-performing vendors for each store in upcoming quarters. Store managers and purchasing teams would be key stakeholders in this analysis, as these insights would help them negotiate better deals with the top-performing vendors and ensure adequate inventory is maintained for those products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction tools trained on historical sales data can unintentionally reinforce existing biases by favoring established vendors or popular categories, potentially sidelining smaller or minority-owned businesses. This lack of fairness may limit opportunities for smaller vendors to make a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to sales data, I would also want access to each store's current inventory of an item after a purchase is made. This would help us analyze whether certain stores frequently sell out of popular products, allowing for more responsive inventory adjustments. Additionally, we could track how quickly specific items sell out during peak periods, such as Christmas, to ensure sufficient stock is available in advance of seasonal demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another valuable piece of data would be whether an item was sold at a discounted price or as part of a promotion. This information could help identify products that are primarily purchased when on sale, enabling more strategic pricing decisions and optimized timing for future promotions. Additionally, vendors can avoid overstocking items that are primarily purchased via promotion or on sale, maximizing profits."
